# Build Guide

Prelim: Your kit should include 7 layers of acrylic, a PCB, and mounting hardware. If you ordered a metal switch plate, your kit will include that and a bag of gaskets as well. The case is made of 3mm acrylic. It can be fragile! Be careful when removing the protective coating. I strongly recommend keeping the case together with the screws until you are ready to build the kit.

1. Start by loading your switch plate with switches. If you have a copper or brass switch plate, there is a front ![front](https://imgur.com/Xw7RRG9.jpg)

and a back. ![back](https://imgur.com/rO5r1PT.jpg)

2. If you have a foam piece, install that next

3. If you plan to use 2u sized keys, install stabilizers next.

4. Next mount the PCB to the plate and solder your switches.

5. If you plan to add LEDs, add those next. Ensure the positive side of the LED ( normally the longer leg) goes through the positive side for the LED and solder away.

6. Now let's mount the case. I prefer to do this upside down. Start with the 2 top pieces and place screws in the outside 4 corners like so:

7a. If you have an acrylic switch plate, add that next.

7b. If you have an metal switch plate, the steps are a little different. First we need to confirm you have the acrylic piece facing the right way. The tabs on the metal are not exactly the same size. To check this, lay the acrylic piece down, then set the metal/PCB component inside like this:

Leaving the PCB resting on your work area, bring the acrylic piece up to it. It should fit perfectly with little, if any, force. If it doesn't fit, move the PCB out of the way, flip the acrylic over, and try again. Once you get that situated, place the acrylic pice on top of the top pieces and place the PCB/plate inside.

Next add the gaskets

8. Now add the 3 layers that allow the USB connection. If you have the metal plate build, ensure the gaskets don't move off the plate.

9. If you bought aluminum feet, mount those now.

10. Mount the bottom.

11. To get the rest of the screws through, try to keep everything together and roll the case towards you.

Now tighten the nuts to the screws and install the remaining nuts and screws.
